# Refactoring a functional example

In Steven Lott's book *Functional Python Programming* there is an implementation of [the assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) using `itertools.permutations()`. I found the code quite hard to understand and decided to test my refactoring skills. I've taken the code from the book's [github repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Functional-Python-Programming-Second-Edition/blob/master/Chapter09/ch09_ex2.py), available under the MIT licence. The refactoring preserves the original function signature and maintains the functional style.

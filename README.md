# Refactoring a functional example

In Steven Lott's book *Functional Python Programming* there is an example using `itertools.permutations`. I found it quite hard to understand and decided to test my refactoring skills. I've taken the code from the book's [github repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Functional-Python-Programming-Second-Edition/blob/master/Chapter09/ch09_ex2.py), available under the MIT licence. The refactoring preserves the original function signature and maintains the functional style.

Any advice on the resulting code is welcome.
